# MakefileExamples
Makefile examples for myself. Includes examples for amd64 assembly. C++ and C examples will be made sometime in the future.
Most likely not the best practises for makefiles but as long as they work for me, I dont care.
## Software you need to run the examples:
- nasm aka. netwide assembler
- gcc
- CMake
- Linux
